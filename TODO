[𐄂] Load outbox of users and parse latest posts
[𐄂] Write these posts to local file
    (normally we would need to sort by time but this is a 
    temporary solution until we really follow the actors 
    and get notifications in timely manner)
[✔] Follow users
[✔] Announcements (read up how boost json looks like)
[✔] Federate the post to our followers (hardcoded for now)
[✔] Actor should have pubActor not the other way around
[✔] Handle more than one local actors
[✔] Fix the json to host those multiple actors
[✔] Fix the json unmarshalling code to read multiple actors
[ ] Handle the /actor endpoint
[ ] Handle http signatures
[ ] Implement database backend
[ ] Write all the announcements (boosts) to the database to 
    their correct actors
[ ] Check if we are already following users
[ ] Handle being followed
[ ] On GetOutbox read the database and present a list of the
    last posts.
[ ] Refactor, comment and clean up

[ ] Check if it's worth it to reuse pubActor instead of creating
    a new one every time
