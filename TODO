[êÑÇ] Load outbox of users and parse latest posts
[êÑÇ] Write these posts to local file
    (normally we would need to sort by time but this is a 
    temporary solution until we really follow the actors 
    and get notifications in timely manner)
[‚úî] Follow users
[‚úî] Announcements (read up how boost json looks like)
[‚úî] Federate the post to our followers (hardcoded for now)
[‚úî] Actor should have pubActor not the other way around
[‚úî] Handle more than one local actors
[‚úî] Fix the json to host those multiple actors
[‚úî] Fix the json unmarshalling code to read multiple actors
[‚úî] Handle the /actor endpoint
[‚úî] Create configuration file
[ ] Implement database backend
    [‚úî] Create a file with the actors we have, their following
        and their followers.
        [‚úî] `MakeActor` should create a file with that actor.
        [‚úî] Implement `LoadActor`
        [‚úî] All but `main.go` should run LoadActor instead of MakeActor
            (Actually nobody should run LoadActor except GetActor)
        [‚úî] `actor.Follow` should write the new following to file
        [‚úî] Handle being followed
        [‚úî] When followed, the handler should write the new follower to file
        [‚úî] Make sure we send our boosts to all our followers
            Code is there but it works sometimes (I hate when this happens)
[ ] Handle http signatures
[ ] Write all the announcements (boosts) to the database to 
    their correct actors
[‚úî] Check if we are already following users
[ ] On GetOutbox read the database and present a list of the
    last posts.
[ ] Refactor, comment and clean up
[ ] Split to pherephone and activityServe
[ ] Check local actor names for characters illegal for filenames and ban them
[ ] Add summary to actors.json
[ ] Check if we're boosting only stuff from actors we follow, not whatever comes
    through in our inbox
[ ] Decide what's to be done with actors removed from `actors.json`.
    [ ] Remove them?
    [ ] Leave them read-only?
    [ ] Leave them as is?
[ ] Check if an early failure in announcing posts causes a problem to the following ones
[ ] Make OS-independent (mosty directory separators)
[ ] Create outbox.json programmatically

[ ] Check if it's worth it to reuse pubActor instead of creating
    a new one every time
