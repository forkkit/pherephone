[𐄂] Load outbox of users and parse latest posts
[𐄂] Write these posts to local file
    (normally we would need to sort by time but this is a 
    temporary solution until we really follow the actors 
    and get notifications in timely manner)
[✔] Follow users
[✔] Announcements (read up how boost json looks like)
[✔] Federate the post to our followers (hardcoded for now)
[✔] Actor should have pubActor not the other way around
[✔] Handle more than one local actors
[✔] Fix the json to host those multiple actors
[✔] Fix the json unmarshalling code to read multiple actors
[✔] Handle the /actor endpoint
[✔] Create configuration file
[✔] Implement database backend
    [✔] Create a file with the actors we have, their following
        and their followers.
        [✔] `MakeActor` should create a file with that actor.
        [✔] Implement `LoadActor`
        [✔] All but `main.go` should run LoadActor instead of MakeActor
            (Actually nobody should run LoadActor except GetActor)
        [✔] `actor.Follow` should write the new following to file
        [✔] Handle being followed
        [✔] When followed, the handler should write the new follower to file
        [✔] Make sure we send our boosts to all our followers
            Code is there but it works sometimes (I hate when this happens)
        [✔] Check why I get calls to get with an id that consists only of an actor's name
        [✔] Implement `db.followers` and `db.following`
[✔] Write all the announcements (boosts) to the database to 
    their correct actors
[✔] Check if we are already following users
[✔] On GetOutbox read the database and present a list of the
    last posts.
[✔] Make OS-independent (mosty directory separators)
[✔] Create outbox.json programmatically
[✔] Make storage configurable (search for "storage" in project)
[✔] Check if we're boosting only stuff from actors we follow, not whatever comes
    through in our inbox
[✔] Boost not only articles but other things too
[✔] Handle post uri's
[✔] Sanitize input, never allow slashes or dots
[✔] Add summary to actors.json
[✔] Check local actor names for characters illegal for filenames and ban them
[✔] Create debug flag
[✔] Write to following only upon accept
    (waiting to actually get an accept so that I can test this)
[✔] Implement webfinger
[ ] Make sure masto finds signature
[ ] Implement Unfollow
[~] Implement accept (accept when other follow us)
    (done but can't test it pending http signatures)
    Works in pleroma/pixelfed not working on masto
    (nothing works on masto)
[ ] Implement nodeinfo and statistics
[✔] Accept even if already follows us
[ ] Implement db.Update
[ ] Implement db.Delete
[ ] Handle paging
[~] Handle http signatures
    masto can't find the signature
[ ] Verify http signatures
[ ] Why doesn't our outbox being fetched by others?
[ ] Refactor, comment and clean up
[ ] Make sure we never show <actor>.json to the public
[ ] Split to pherephone and activityServe
[ ] Decide what's to be done with actors removed from `actors.json`.
    [ ] Remove them?
    [ ] Leave them read-only?
    [ ] Leave them as is?
[ ] Check if an early failure in announcing posts causes a problem to the following ones
[✔] Handle followers and following uri's
[ ] Do I care about the inbox?
[ ] Maybe look at implementing lock files?
[𐄂] Check if it's worth it to reuse pubActor instead of creating
    a new one every time
